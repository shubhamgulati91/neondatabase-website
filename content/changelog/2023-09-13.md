### Fixes & improvements

- API: Increased the pagination limit for the [List projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) API method from 100 to 400.
- UI: Fixed an issue on the **Billing** page for Free Tier accounts that prevented content in the **Estimate Pro plan cost** section of the page from being displayed.
- UI: Updated pages and modals in the console to ensure compute size default values are displayed correctly and consistently.
- UI: Removed the **Postgres configuration** widget from the Neon **Dashboard**. The Postgres version for the project now appears in the **Compute** widget.
- UI: Unnecessary whitespace is now stripped from queries executed in the Neon SQL Editor during processing. Previously, queries indented with a tab character failed to run or did not run as expected.
