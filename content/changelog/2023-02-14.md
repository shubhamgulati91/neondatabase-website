### Fixes & improvements

- Compute: Added support for the Postgres `pgvector`, `plls` and `plcoffee` extensions. For more information about Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).
- Pageserver: Added an experimental feature that automatically evicts layer files from Pageservers to optimize local storage space usage. When enabled for a project, Pageservers periodically check the access timestamps of the project's layer files. If the most recent layer file access is further in the past than a configurable threshold, the Pageserver removes the layer file from local storage. The authoritative copy of the layer file remains in S3. A Pageserver can download a layer file from S3 on-demand if it is needed again, to reconstruct a page version for a client request, for example.
- Proxy: Significantly reduced network latencies for WebSocket and pooled connections by implementing caching mechanism for compute node connection information and enabling the `TCP_NODELAY` protocol option. The `TCP_NODELAY` option causes segments to be sent as soon as possible, even if there is only a small amount of data. For more information, refer to the [TCP protocol man page](https://linux.die.net/man/7/tcp).
