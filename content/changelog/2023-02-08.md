### Fixes & improvements

- API: The `default_endpoint_settings` property in the `Project` schema was split into `default_endpoint_settings` and `settings`. The `default_endpoint_settings` property is now used exclusively for Postgres specific settings applied to a project's compute endpoints. The `settings` property is used for general project settings such as the compute `quota`. If you have been using `createProject` or `updateProject` API requests in your code, you may need to update those requests to account for this change.
- UI: Updated various UI elements in the Neon Console to rename **Endpoints** to **Compute endpoints**. The term _Endpoint_ was not specific enough to accurately reflect the resource being referred to. A **Compute endpoint** in Neon refers the compute instance that runs Postgres.
- UI: Added a `DEFAULT` badge to identify the default branch of a Neon project. The badge is visible on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console and in other UI elements that show a project's branches.
