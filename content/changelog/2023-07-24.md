### Scale to zero delay project defaults

Neon now provides an **Scale to zero delay** control on the project creation dialog, enabling Neon Pro plan users to define a default scale to zero setting for a project's compute endpoints. The scale to zero setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. For more information, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

- UI: Fixed OAuth page styling and other minor style issues for the Neon Console dark mode theme.
