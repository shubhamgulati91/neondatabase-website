### Postgres extension support

Added support for several Postgres extensions. Newly supported extensions include:

- `bloom`
- `pgrowlocks`
- `intagg`
- `pgstattuple`
- `earthdistance`
- `address_standardizer`
- `address_standardizer_data_us`

For more information about Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

### Fixes & improvements

- Compute: Updated the list of Postgres client libraries and runtimes that Neon tests for connection support. The `pg8000` Python Postgres driver, version 1.29.3 and higher, now supports connecting to Neon.
- Compute: Added statistics to `EXPLAIN` that show prefetch hits and misses for sequential scans.
- Proxy: Updated the error message that is reported when attempting to connect from a client or driver that does not support Server Name Indication (SNI). For more information about the SNI requirement, see [Connection errors](/docs/connect/connection-errors). Previously, the error message indicated that the "Project ID" is not specified. The error message now states that the "Endpoint ID" is not specified. Connecting to Neon with a Project ID remains supported for backward compatibility, but connecting with an Endpoint ID is now the recommended connection method. For general information about connecting to Neon, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/).
