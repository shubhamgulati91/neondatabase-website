### Fixes & improvements

- Updated the `pgvector` extension to version 0.4.4. If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.
- Added a check for available memory when creating an Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index using the `pg_embedding` extension. HNSW builds indexes in memory. Insufficient memory for the index size could result in out-of-memory errors.
