### Email authentication support

Neon now supports email authentication, enabling users to sign up for Neon using a personal or business email account. Previously, you could only sign up with a GitHub or Google account.

To sign up with an email account, navigate to [https://console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech), select the **Email** option, and click **Sign up for an account**. You will be directed to the **Sign up** dialog.
