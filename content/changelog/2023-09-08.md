### Configure default compute settings for your project

[Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can now configure default compute settings for a Neon project. Settings include **Compute size**, **Autoscaling**, and **Scale to zero delay**. To define defaults, select **Project settings** > **Compute** from the Neon **Dashboard** to open the **Default compute settings** page. For [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, the page shows the default settings.

Default settings are applied when creating a branch or adding a compute to a branch via the Neon Console. However, if you want a compute with different settings, you can change or override the defaults when creating a branch or adding a compute.

In addition, the **Compute** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** now shows the **Default compute size** for your Neon project.

### Fixes & improvements

- API: Neon API v1 deprecation was [announced in December, 2022](/docs/changelog/2022-12-28-console). We have removed code for this early version of the Neon API. If you have not yet migrated your applications to the current version of the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), please do so now.
- UI: Added a **Billing** page to the Neon Console for Neon Enterprise and Platform Partnership custom plan users. The **Billing** page is accessible from the sidebar in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
- UI: Addressed usability issues on the **Custom** tab of the **Pro Plan Cost Estimator**, which is accessible from the Free Tier **Billing** page in the Neon Console. Percentage values were not restored when switching from **Enter your own values** and **Use a percentage**. Additionally, minimum, maximum, and increment values were adjusted for **Compute** and **Project storage** metrics.
- UI: The billing period drop-down menu at the top right corner of the **Billing** page now uses the current billing period as the default selection instead of the oldest billing period. This change applies to Neon Pro plan accounts.
