### Pro Plan Cost Estimation tool enhancements

**Typical use cases** and **Custom** tabs were added to the **Pro Plan Cost Estimation** tool that is accessible from the **Billing** page on the Neon Free Tier. This tool helps you estimate what your monthly cost would be if you upgraded to the [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan).

- The **Typical uses case** tab provides cost estimates for predefined **Prototype**, **Launch**, and **Scale** use cases.
- The **Custom** tab allows you to estimate costs based on compute and storage usage values that you provide.

### Fixes & improvements

- API: Added a `suspend_timeout_seconds` parameter to the `default_endpoint_settings` object in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) API. This parameter defines the amount of time before the project's default compute endpoint is suspended due to inactivity. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
- API: Deprecated the `autoscaling_limit_min_cu` and `autoscaling_limit_min_cu` parameters in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) `project` object. You can configure these parameters in the `default_endpoint_settings` object instead when creating a project.
- Control Plane: The default password encryption method for roles in Neon was changed to `scram-sha-256`.
- Control Plane: Upgraded PGBouncer to a Bitnami version that does not wait for the Postgres instance to become accessible before starting PgBouncer. Additionally, to optimize compute startup times, the `server_login_retry` setting in PgBouncer's configuration was adjusted to remove any delay between Postgres connection retries.
- Control Plane: Autoscaling minimum and maximum values are now validated to ensure only valid values are permitted.
- UI: Invoices from past months did not appear on the **Billing** page for Neon Pro plan accounts.
