### Fixes & improvements

- Compute: Installed the `uuid-ossp` extension binaries, which provide functions for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). `CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp"` is now supported. For information about extensions supported by Neon, see [Available Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).
- Compute: Added logging for compute node initialization failure during the 'basebackup' stage.
- Pageserver: Avoided busy looping when deletion from cloud storage is skipped due to failed upload tasks.
- Pageserver: Merged the 'wal_receiver' endpoint with 'timeline_detail', in the internal management API.
- Pageserver: Added reporting of the physical size with the tenant status, in the internal management API.
