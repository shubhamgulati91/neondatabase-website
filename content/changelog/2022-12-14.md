### Fixes & improvements

- API: The request body for the create branch API is now optional. Previously, a request body with `branch` or `endpoints` attributes was required. Without a request body, the default behavior is to create a branch from the project's root branch (`main`) without an endpoint, and the branch name is auto-generated.
- Control Plane: Neon now attempts to deploy compute resources in the same availability zone as the [Pageserver](/docs/reference/glossary#pageserver).
- UI: Removed the password from the connection string that is displayed in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** after project creation. A connection string and `.env` file with the password are provided in a pop-up dialog after creating a project.
- UI: Neon's passwordless auth feature no longer requires selecting an endpoint for projects with a single endpoint.
