### History retention and point-in-time restore

You can now configure the history retention period for a Neon project. History retention enables [point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore), allowing you to restore data to any point within the retention period. By default, Neon retains a 7-day history of data changes for all branches. The supported history retention range is 0 to 7 days for [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, and 0 to 30 days for [Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users.

The **History retention** setting is located in the Neon Console under **Project settings** > **Storage**.

### Configurable Scale to zero

After an extensive testing period, we are pleased to announce that our _Configurable scale to zero_ feature has successfully transitioned out of Beta. This feature controls when a Neon compute instance scales to zero due to inactivity. For more information, see [Configuring Scale to zero for Neon computes](/docs/guides/scale-to-zero-guide).

### Fixes & improvements

- API: The [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) API method now creates a branch from the project's default branch if a `parent_id` is not provided in the create branch request.
- API: Deprecated the `pooler_enabled` attribute in the [Create endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) API method. This attribute is no longer required, as you can now enable connection pooling by adding a `-pooler` flag to a database connection string. See [How to use connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling#how-to-use-connection-pooling).

- UI: The **Compute** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** now displays the **Active computes** limit for your Neon project. There is a default limit of 20 simultaneously active computes to protect Neon accounts from unintended or unexpected usage. [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can have the limit increased by [submitting a request to our support team](/docs/introduction/support).
- UI: Fixed an issue on the **Downgrade** dialog accessible from the Neon Pro plan **Billing** page that prevented selecting a reason for downgrading.
- UI: Fixed dark theme styling issues.
