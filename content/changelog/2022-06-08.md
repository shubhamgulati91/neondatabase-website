### Fixes & improvements

- API: Changed the `user_id` type from `int64` to `uuid`.
- API: Implemented a unified JSON error response where possible, in the format of `{ "message": "error text" }`.
- API: Made `platform`, `region`, and `instance_type` ids optional during new project creation.
- Control Plane: Fixed an issue that allowed the `web_access` system role to be modified or deleted, which could affect the functioning of the Neon SQL Editor.
- UI: The Neon Technical Preview invite code is now requested only at the first login.
- UI: Added a cover to password fields to protect passwords from view. Passwords are presented to users after performing actions such as creating a project, creating a user, or resetting a password.
