### Fixes & improvements

- Control Plane: Improved compute startup and compute availability check times by avoiding unnecessary catalog update steps already performed during initial compute startup.
- UI: Fixed a project creation issue that occurred when specifying a long project name. The **Name** field in the **Project Creation** modal now validates project names to ensure they are no more than 64 characters in length.
