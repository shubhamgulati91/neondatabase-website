### Documentation updates

- Added Neon API [Operation endpoint examples](/docs/manage/operations#operations-and-the-neon-api) and a topic describing how to [poll operation status](/docs/manage/operations#poll-operation-status). When working with the Neon API programmatically, it may be necessary to poll operations to ensure that currently running API requests are finished before proceeding with the next request.
- Introduced a new [Neon API documentation](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) user interface. The new UI is more user-friendly, easier to navigate, and offers a more intuitive design, making it easier for developers to find what they need and get started with our APIs quickly. The UI can be viewed in light or dark mode and includes a **Try it** feature that allows you execute API requests from your browser.
