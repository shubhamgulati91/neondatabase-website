### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Adjusted how autoscaling minimum and maximum compute sizes are displayed in the **Compute endpoints** table on the branch details page.
- UI: Added a **History retention** metric to the **Storage** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. By default, Neon retains a 7-day history of data changes to support [point-in-time restore](/docs/reference/glossary#point-in-time-restore). History retention will become a configurable setting in a future release.
- UI: Enhanced the **Request Downgrade** modal, which is accessible from the **Billing** page in the console. Downgrading from Neon's [Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) back to the [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) is now a fully automated and instant process. This change eliminates the previously required step of sending a downgrade request to Neon support.
- Control Plane: Adjusted the time interval for measuring compute utilization in Neon to avoid rounding decisions and ensure accuracy for fractional compute sizes.
- UI: Fixed modals in the console to enable form submission when the **Enter** key is pressed.
- UI: Fixed submission buttons that remained enabled after being clicked and while form data was being submitted.
