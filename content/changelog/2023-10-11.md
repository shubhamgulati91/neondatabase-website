### Fixes & improvements

The following items affect the Neon serverless driver, which is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that allows you to query data from serverless and edge environments over HTTP or WebSockets in place of TCP:

- Proxy: Increased the maximum request body size for SQL requests over HTTP from 1 MB to 10 MB.
- Proxy: Added a 15 second proxy timeout for SQL requests over HTTP for handling of long running queries.

For more information about our serverless driver, see [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver).
