### Fixes & improvements

- API: Changed the error reported when a concurrent operation on a project prevents acquiring a project lock. Error `423 Locked` is now reported instead of `409 Conflict`.
- Control plane: Implemented the usage of several instances for serving the public API and web UI to enable zero-downtime deployments.
- UI: Added an **Enable pooling** toggle to the project **General setting** page, which permits enabling or disabling connection pooling for a project. For more information about Neon connection pooling support, see [Connection pooling](/docs/get-started-with-neon/connection-pooling/).
