### Postgres extension support

- Added support for the [pgx_ulid](https://github.com/pksunkara/pgx_ulid) extension, which enables using ULIDs within Postgres.
- Added support for the [rdkit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit) extension, which extends Postgres with data types and functions for working with chemical informatics data, turning Postgres into a cheminformatics database.

For more information about Postgres extensions supported by Neon and how to install them, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).
