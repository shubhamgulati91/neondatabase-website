### Fixes & improvements

- API: Added a `quota_reset_at` property to the `Project` response schema in the Neon API. This property displays a future date indicating when a resource consumption quota will be reset. For example, the Neon Free Tier offers 100 compute hours per month. The `quota_reset_at` property shows when that quota will be set back to 100 hours.
- API: Added a `compute_seconds_limit` property to the `CurrentUserInfoResponse` schema in the Neon API. This property defines the monthly compute limit in terms of compute seconds.
- Integrations: The [Neon integration with Vercel](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) did not create branches for preview deployments when the Vercel user ID differed from the one specified when adding the Neon integration to Vercel. This issue was encountered when using the Neon integration from a [Vercel Teams](https://vercel.com/docs/teams-and-accounts/create-or-join-a-team) account.
