Variable traffic patterns are common, but traditional managed databases require provisioning a fixed amount of CPU and memory. It is common practice to provision for peak traffic, which means paying for peak capacity 24/7 â€” even though it's needed only a fraction of the time.

**Serverless databases like Neon allow teams to lower their costs by scaling up/down automatically in response to load, and scaling down to zero when the database is inactive**. This autoscaling pattern also reduces manual work for developers, who don't have to worry about resizing instances.

## How it works: A closer look

Two key features are behind Neon's efficiency for variable traffic patterns: [Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/blog/scaling-serverless-postgres) and [Scale to Zero](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/auto-suspend).

For production databases that stay on 24/7:

- Via autoscaling, Neon adjusts CPU/memory up and down automatically. This scaling is very responsive and it happens nearly instantly. [Read about our autoscaling algorithm](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-algorithm).
- Costs are controlled by setting a [max autoscaling limit](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/autoscaling). Your database will never autoscale above this limit.
- No manual resizes or downtimes. You will get a performance boost when you need it, and once traffic slows down, Neon will scale you back down without downtime.

For databases that are only used a few hours per day, for example, dev/test databases:

- Your databases will automatically scale to zero when inactive. Instead of paying for compute 24/7, you reduce the costs of your supporting databases to a minimum, without manual work.
- Once you query them again, Neon databases reactivate in less than a second (a few hundred ms on average).
