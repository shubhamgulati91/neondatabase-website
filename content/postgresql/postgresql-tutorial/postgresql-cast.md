**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to use PostgreSQL `CAST()` function and operator to convert a value of one type to another.

## Introduction to PostgreSQL CAST() function and cast operator (::)

There are many cases in which you want to convert a value of one [type](postgresql-data-types) into another. PostgreSQL offers the `CAST()` function and cast operator (`::`) to do this.

### PostgreSQL CAST() function

Here’s the basic syntax of the type `CAST()` function:

```phpsqlsql
CAST(<code>value</code> AS target_type );
```

In this syntax:

- First, provide a `value` that you want to convert. It can be a constant, a table column, or an expression.
- Then, specify the target [data type](postgresql-data-types) to which you want to convert the `value`.

The `CAST()` returns a value after it has been cast to the specified target data type. If the `CAST()` function cannot cast the value to a target type, it’ll raise an error. The error message will depend on the nature of the conversion failure.

### PostgreSQL cast operator (::)

Besides the type `CAST()` function, you can use the following cast operator (`::`) to convert a value of one type into another:

```sql
value::target_type
```

In this syntax:

- `value` is a value that you want to convert.
- `target_type` specifies the target type that you want to cast the value to.

The cast operator `::` returns a value after casting the `value` to the `target_type` or raise an error if the cast fails.

Notice that the cast operator (::) is PostgreSQL\-specific and does not conform to the SQL standard

## PostgreSQL CAST() function and cast operator (::) examples

Let’s take some examples of using the `CAST` operator to convert a value of one type to another.

### 1\) Cast a string to an integer example

The following statement uses the `CAST()` operator to convert a string to an integer:

```sql
SELECT
  CAST ('100' AS INTEGER);
```

Output:

```text
 int4
------
  100
(1 row)
```

If the expression cannot be converted to the target type, PostgreSQL will raise an error. For example:

```
SELECT
  CAST ('10C' AS INTEGER);
```

```sql
[Err] ERROR:  invalid input syntax for integer: "10C"
LINE 2:  CAST ('10C' AS INTEGER);
```

### 2\) Cast a string to a date example

This example uses the `CAST()` function to convert a string to a [date](postgresql-date):

```php
SELECT
   CAST ('2015-01-01' AS DATE),
   CAST ('01-OCT-2015' AS DATE);
```

Output:

```text
    date    |    date
------------+------------
 2015-01-01 | 2015-10-01
(1 row)
```

In this example, we converted `2015-01-01` literal string into `January 1st 2015` and `01-OCT-2015` to `October 1st 2015`.

### 3\) Cast a string to a double example

The following example uses the CAST() function to convert a string `'10.2'` into a double:

```
SELECT
	CAST ('10.2' AS DOUBLE);
```

Whoops, we got the following error message:

```sql
[Err] ERROR:  type "double" does not exist
LINE 2:  CAST ('10.2' AS DOUBLE)
```

To fix this, you need to use `DOUBLE PRECISION` instead of `DOUBLE` as follows:

```css
SELECT
   CAST ('10.2' AS DOUBLE PRECISION);
```

Output:

```text
 float8
--------
   10.2
(1 row)
```

### 4\) Cast a string to a boolean example

This example uses the `CAST()` to convert the string ‘true’, ‘T’ to true and ‘false’, ‘F’ to false:

```css
SELECT
   CAST('true' AS BOOLEAN),
   CAST('false' as BOOLEAN),
   CAST('T' as BOOLEAN),
   CAST('F' as BOOLEAN);
```

Output:

```text
 bool | bool | bool | bool
------+------+------+------
 t    | f    | t    | f
(1 row)

```

### 5\) Cast a string to a timestamp example

This example uses the cast operator (::) to convert a string to a [timestamp](postgresql-timestamp):

```
SELECT '2019-06-15 14:30:20'::timestamp;
```

Output:

```text
      timestamp
---------------------
 2019-06-15 14:30:20
(1 row)
```

### 6\) Cast a string to an interval example

This example uses the cast operator to convert a string to an [interval](postgresql-interval):

```php
SELECT
  '15 minute' :: interval,
  '2 hour' :: interval,
  '1 day' :: interval,
  '2 week' :: interval,
  '3 month' :: interval;
```

Output:

```text
 interval | interval | interval | interval | interval
----------+----------+----------+----------+----------
 00:15:00 | 02:00:00 | 1 day    | 14 days  | 3 mons
(1 row)
```

### 7\) Cast a timestamp to a date example

The following example uses the `CAST()` to convert a timestamp to a date:

```
SELECT CAST('2024-02-01 12:34:56' AS DATE);
```

Output:

```text
    date
------------
 2024-02-01
(1 row)
```

### 8\) Cast an interval to text

The following example uses `CAST()` function to convert an interval to text:

```
SELECT CAST('30 days' AS TEXT);
```

Output:

```text
  text
---------
 30 days
(1 row)
```

### 10\) Cast a JSON to a JSONB

The following example uses the `CAST()` function to convert JSON to JSONB:

```
SELECT CAST('{"name": "John"}' AS JSONB);
```

Output:

```text
      jsonb
------------------
 {"name": "John"}
(1 row)
```

### 11\) Cast a double precision to an integer

The following example uses `CAST()` function to convert double precision to integer:

```
SELECT CAST(9.99 AS INTEGER);
```

Output:

```text
 int4
------
   10
(1 row)
```

### 12\) Cast an array to a text

The following example uses `CAST()` function to convert an array to text:

```
SELECT CAST(ARRAY[1, 2, 3] AS TEXT);
```

Output:

```php
  array
---------
 {1,2,3}
(1 row)
```

### 13\) Cast text to an array

The following example shows how to use the cast operator (::) to convert text to an array:

```php
SELECT '{1,2,3}'::INTEGER[] AS result_array;
```

Output:

```
 result_array
--------------
 {1,2,3}
(1 row)
```

### 14\) Using CAST with table data example

First, [create](postgresql-create-table) a `ratings` table that consists of two columns: `id` and `rating`:

```
CREATE TABLE ratings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  rating VARCHAR (1) NOT NULL
);
```

Second, [insert some sample data](postgresql-insert) into the `ratings` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO ratings (rating)
VALUES
  ('A'),
  ('B'),
  ('C');
```

Because the requirements change, we have to use the same `ratings` table to store ratings as numbers 1, 2, and 3 instead of A, B, and C:

```sql
INSERT INTO ratings (rating)
VALUES
  (1),
  (2),
  (3);
```

Consequentially, the `ratings` table stores both alphabets \& numbers.

```sql
SELECT * FROM ratings;
```

Output:

```text
 id | rating
----+--------
  1 | A
  2 | B
  3 | C
  4 | 1
  5 | 2
  6 | 3
(6 rows)
```

Now, we have to convert all values in the `rating` column into integers, all other A, B, C ratings will be displayed as zero.

To achieve this, you can use the [`CASE`](../postgresql-plpgsql/plpgsql-case-statement) expression with the type `CAST` as shown in the following query:

```
SELECT
  id,
  CASE WHEN rating~E'^\\d+$' THEN CAST (rating AS INTEGER) ELSE 0 END as rating
FROM
  ratings;
```

Output:

```
 id | rating
----+--------
  1 |      0
  2 |      0
  3 |      0
  4 |      1
  5 |      2
  6 |      3
(6 rows)
```

In this example:

- `rating ~ E'^\\d+$'`: This expression matches the values in the rating column with a regular expression `E'^\\d+$'`. The pattern checks if a value contains only digits (`\d+`) from the beginning (`^`) to the end (`$`). The letter `E` before the string indicates is an escape string.
- If the value contains only digits, the `CAST()` function converts it to an integer. Otherwise, it returns zero.

In this tutorial, you have learned how to use PostgreSQL `CAST` to convert a value of one type to another.
