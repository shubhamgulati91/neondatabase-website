**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to handle PostgreSQL transactions using the `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` statements.

## What is a database transaction?

A database transaction is a single unit of work that consists of one or more operations.

A classical example of a transaction is a bank transfer from one account to another. A complete transaction must ensure a balance between the sender and receiver accounts.

This implies that if the sender account transfers X amount, the receiver receives exactly X amount, neither more nor less.

A PostgreSQL transaction is atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. These properties are often referred to collectively as ACID:

- **Atomicity** guarantees that the transaction is completed in an all\-or\-nothing manner.
- **Consistency** ensures that changes to data written to the database are valid and adhere to predefined rules.
- **Isolation** determines how the integrity of a transaction is visible to other transactions.
- **Durability** ensures that transactions that have been committed are permanently stored in the database.

## Setting up a sample table

Let’s [create a new table](postgresql-create-table) called `accounts` for the demonstration:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS accounts;

CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    balance DEC(15,2) NOT NULL CHECK(balance >= 0),
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
```

## Begin a transaction

When you execute a statement, PostgreSQL implicitly wraps it in a transaction.

For example, when you execute the following [`INSERT`](postgresql-insert) statement, PostgreSQL immediately inserts a new row into the `accounts` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO accounts(name,balance)
VALUES('Bob',10000);
```

To start a transaction explicitly, you execute either one of the following statements:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```

Or

```sql
BEGIN WORK;
```

Or

```sql
BEGIN;
```

For example, the following statements start a new transaction and insert a new account into the `accounts` table:

```sql
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO accounts(name,balance)
VALUES('Alice',10000);
```

From the current session, you can see the change by retrieving data from the `accounts` table:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    name,
    balance
FROM
    accounts;
```

However, you will not see the change if you connect to the PostgreSQL server in a new session and execute the query above:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    name,
    balance
FROM
    accounts;
```

## Commit a transaction

To permanently apply the change to the database, you commit the transaction by using the `COMMIT WORK` statement:

```sql
COMMIT WORK;
```

or

```sql
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

or simply:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

Other sessions can view the change by retrieving data from the `accounts` table:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    name,
    balance
FROM
    accounts;
```

![PostgreSQL Transaction - commit](/postgresqltutorial/PostgreSQL-Transaction-from-current-transaction.png)
After executing the `COMMIT` statement, PostgreSQL guarantees that the change will be durable if a crash happens.

Put it all together.

```sql
-- start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- insert a new row into the accounts table
INSERT INTO accounts(name,balance)
VALUES('Alice',10000);

-- commit the change (or roll it back later)
COMMIT;
```

## Roll back a transaction

If you want to undo the changes to the database, you can use the ROLLBACK statement:

```
ROLLBACK;
```

Or more clear:

```
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
```

Or:

```
ROLLBACK WORK;
```

The `ROLLBACK` statement undos the changes that you made within the transaction.

For example, the following example uses the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back the changes made to the account 1:

```
-- start a transaction
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 1000
WHERE id =  1;

-- rollback the changes
ROLLBACK;
```

If you retrieve data from the accounts table, you’ll won’t see the changes because it was rolled back.

```
SELECT * FROM accounts;
```

Output:

```
 id | name  | balance
----+-------+----------
  1 | Bob   | 10000.00
  2 | Alice | 10000.00
(2 rows)
```

In practice, you’ll use transactions in [stored procedures](../postgresql-plpgsql/postgresql-create-procedure) in PostgreSQL and in the application code such as [PHP](../postgresql-php/transaction), [Java](../postgresql-jdbc/transaction), and [Python](../postgresql-python/transaction).

## Summary

- Use the `BEGIN` statement to explicitly start a transaction
- Use the `COMMIT` statement to apply the changes permanently to the database.
- Use the `ROLLBACK` statement to undo the changes made to the database during the transaction.
