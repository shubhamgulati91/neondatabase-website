**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to use the PostgreSQL `EXCEPT` operator to return a result set containing the rows in the first query that does not appear in the output of the second query.

## Introduction to the PostgreSQL EXCEPT operator

Like the [UNION](postgresql-union) and [INTERSECT](postgresql-intersect) operators, the `EXCEPT` operator returns rows by comparing the result sets of two or more queries.

The `EXCEPT` operator returns distinct rows from the first (left) query that are not in the second (right) query.

The following illustrates the syntax of the `EXCEPT` operator.

```sql
SELECT select_list
FROM A
EXCEPT
SELECT select_list
FROM B;
```

The queries that involve the `EXCEPT` need to follow these rules:

- The number of columns and their orders must be the same in the two queries.
- The data types of the respective columns must be compatible.

The following Venn diagram illustrates the `EXCEPT` operator:

![PostgreSQL EXCEPT](/postgresqltutorial/PostgreSQL-EXCEPT-300x202.png)If you want to sort the rows in the combined result sets, you need to place the [`ORDER BY`](postgresql-order-by) clause after the second query:

```sql
SELECT select_list
FROM A
EXCEPT
SELECT select_list
FROM B
ORDER BY sort_expression;
```

## Setting up sample tables

We’ll create the `top_rated_films` and `most_popular_films` tables for demonstration:

```sql
CREATE TABLE top_rated_films(
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  release_year SMALLINT
);

CREATE TABLE most_popular_films(
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  release_year SMALLINT
);

INSERT INTO top_rated_films(title, release_year)
VALUES
   ('The Shawshank Redemption', 1994),
   ('The Godfather', 1972),
   ('The Dark Knight', 2008),
   ('12 Angry Men', 1957);

INSERT INTO most_popular_films(title, release_year)
VALUES
  ('An American Pickle', 2020),
  ('The Godfather', 1972),
  ('The Dark Knight', 2008),
  ('Greyhound', 2020);

SELECT * FROM top_rated_films;
SELECT * FROM most_popular_films;
```

The contents of the `top_rated_films` table:

```text
          title           | release_year
--------------------------+--------------
 The Shawshank Redemption |         1994
 The Godfather            |         1972
 The Dark Knight          |         2008
 12 Angry Men             |         1957
(4 rows)
```

The contents of the `most_popular_films` table:

```text
       title        | release_year
--------------------+--------------
 An American Pickle |         2020
 The Godfather      |         1972
 The Dark Knight    |         2008
 Greyhound          |         2020
(4 rows)
```

## PostgreSQL EXCEPT operator examples

Let’s take some examples of using the `EXCEPT` operator

### 1\) Basic EXCEPT operator example

The following statement uses the `EXCEPT` operator to find the top\-rated films that are not popular:

```sql
SELECT * FROM top_rated_films
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM most_popular_films;
```

Output:

```text
          title           | release_year
--------------------------+--------------
 The Shawshank Redemption |         1994
 12 Angry Men             |         1957
(2 rows)
```

### 2\) Using the EXCEPT operator with the ORDER BY clause

The following statement uses the `ORDER BY` clause in the query to sort the result set returned by the `EXCEPT` operator by titles:

```sql
SELECT * FROM top_rated_films
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM most_popular_films
ORDER BY title;
```

Output:

```text
          title           | release_year
--------------------------+--------------
 12 Angry Men             |         1957
 The Shawshank Redemption |         1994
(2 rows)
```

Notice that we placed the [ORDER BY](postgresql-order-by) clause after the second query to sort the films by titles.

## Summary

- Use the PostgreSQL `EXCEPT` operator to combine rows from two result sets and return a result set containing rows from the first result set that do not appear in the second result set.
