**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to use the PostgreSQL `FETCH` clause to retrieve a portion of rows returned by a query.

## Introduction to PostgreSQL FETCH clause

To skip a certain number of rows and retrieve a specific number of rows, you often use the [`LIMIT`](postgresql-limit) clause in the `SELECT` statement.

The `LIMIT` clause is widely used by many Relational Database Management Systems such as MySQL, H2, and HSQLDB. However, the `LIMIT` clause is not a SQL standard.

To conform with the SQL standard, PostgreSQL supports the `FETCH` clause to skip a certain number of rows and then fetch a specific number of rows.

Note that the `FETCH` clause was introduced as a part of the SQL standard in SQL:2008\.

The following illustrates the syntax of the PostgreSQL `FETCH` clause:

```sql
OFFSET row_to_skip { ROW | ROWS }
FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ row_count ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY
```

In this syntax:

First, specify the number of rows to skip (`row_to_skip`) after the `OFFSET` keyword. The start is an integer that is zero or positive. It defaults to 0, meaning the query will skip no rows.

If the `row_to_skip` is higher than the number of rows in the table, the query will return no rows.

Second, provide the number of rows to retrieve (`row_count`) in the `FETCH` clause. The `row_count` must be an integer 1 or greater. The `row_count` defaults to 1\.

The `ROW` is the synonym for `ROWS`, `FIRST` is the synonym for `NEXT` so you can use them interchangeably.

Because the table stores the rows in an unspecified order, you should always use the `FETCH` clause with the [`ORDER BY`](postgresql-order-by) clause to make the order of rows consistent.

Note that the `OFFSET` clause must come before the `FETCH` clause in SQL:2008\. However, `OFFSET` and `FETCH` clauses can appear in any order in PostgreSQL.

### FETCH vs. LIMIT

The `FETCH` clause is functionally equivalent to the `LIMIT` clause. If you plan to make your application compatible with other database systems, you should use the `FETCH` clause because it follows the standard SQL.

## PostgreSQL FETCH examples

Letâ€™s use the `film` table in the [sample database](../postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database) for the demonstration.

![Film Table](/postgresqltutorial/film_table.png)The following query uses the `FETCH` clause to select the first film sorted by titles in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title
FETCH FIRST ROW ONLY;
```

Output:

```text
 film_id |      title
---------+------------------
       1 | Academy Dinosaur
(1 row)
```

It is equivalent to the following query:

```
SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
```

The following query uses the `FETCH` clause to select the first five films sorted by titles:

```sql
SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title
FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;
```

Output:

```text
 film_id |      title
---------+------------------
       1 | Academy Dinosaur
       2 | Ace Goldfinger
       3 | Adaptation Holes
       4 | Affair Prejudice
       5 | African Egg
(5 rows)
```

The following statement returns the next five films after the first five films sorted by titles:

```
SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title
OFFSET 5 ROWS
FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;
```

Output:

```
 film_id |      title
---------+------------------
       6 | Agent Truman
       7 | Airplane Sierra
       8 | Airport Pollock
       9 | Alabama Devil
      10 | Aladdin Calendar
(5 rows)
```

## Summary

- Use the PostgreSQL `FETCH` clause to skip a certain number of rows and retrieve a specific number of rows from a query.
