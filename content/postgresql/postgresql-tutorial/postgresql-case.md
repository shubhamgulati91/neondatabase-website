**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to use the **PostgreSQL CASE** conditional expression to form conditional queries.

The PostgreSQL `CASE` expression is the same as `IF/ELSE` statement in other programming languages. It allows you to add if\-else logic to the query to form a powerful query.

Since `CASE` is an expression, you can use it in any place where you would use an expression such as [`SELECT`](postgresql-select), [`WHERE`](postgresql-where), [`GROUP BY`](postgresql-group-by), and [`HAVING`](postgresql-having) clauses.

The `CASE` expression has two forms:

- General
- Simple

## General PostgreSQL CASE expression

The following illustrates the general form of the `CASE` statement:

```phpsql
CASE
      WHEN condition_1  THEN result_1
      WHEN condition_2  THEN result_2
      [WHEN ...]
      [ELSE else_result]
END
```

In this syntax, each condition (`condition_1`, `condition_2`…) is a boolean expression that returns either `true` or `false`.

When a condition evaluates to `false`, the `CASE` expression evaluates the next condition from top to bottom until it finds a condition that evaluates to `true`.

If a condition evaluates to `true`, the `CASE` expression returns the corresponding result that follows the condition.

For example, if the `condition_2` evaluates to `true`, the `CASE` expression returns the `result_2`. Also, it immediately stops evaluating the remaining expressions.

If all conditions are `false`, the `CASE` expression returns the result (`else_result`) that follows the `ELSE` keyword. If you omit the `ELSE` clause, the `CASE` expression returns `NULL`.

### 1\) The general CASE example

Let’s take a look at the `film` table from the [sample database](../postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database).

![](/postgresqltutorial/film.png)Suppose you want to label the films by their lengths based on the following logic:

- If the length is less than 50 minutes, the film is short.
- If the length is greater than 50 minutes and less than or equal to 120 minutes, the film is medium.
- If the length is greater than 120 minutes, the film is long.

To apply this logic, you can use the `CASE` expression in the `SELECT` statement as follows:

```sql
SELECT
  title,
  length,
  CASE WHEN length > 0
  AND length <= 50 THEN 'Short' WHEN length > 50
  AND length <= 120 THEN 'Medium' WHEN length > 120 THEN 'Long' END duration
FROM
  film
ORDER BY
  title;
```

Output:

```php
            title            | length | duration
-----------------------------+--------+----------
 Academy Dinosaur            |     86 | Medium
 Ace Goldfinger              |     48 | Short
 Adaptation Holes            |     50 | Short
 Affair Prejudice            |    117 | Medium
 African Egg                 |    130 | Long
 Agent Truman                |    169 | Long
```

Note that we placed a [column alias](postgresql-column-alias) `duration` after the `CASE` expression.

### 2\) Using CASE with an aggregate function example

Suppose that you want to assign price segments to films with the following logic:

- If the rental rate is 0\.99, the film is economic.
- If the rental rate is 1\.99, the film is mass.
- If the rental rate is 4\.99, the film is premium.

And you want to know the number of films that belong to economy, mass, and premium.

In this case, you can use the `CASE` expression to construct the query as follows:

```
SELECT
  SUM (
    CASE WHEN rental_rate = 0.99 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
  ) AS "Economy",
  SUM (
    CASE WHEN rental_rate = 2.99 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
  ) AS "Mass",
  SUM (
    CASE WHEN rental_rate = 4.99 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
  ) AS "Premium"
FROM
  film;

```

The result of the query is as follows:

```text
 Economy | Mass | Premium
---------+------+---------
     341 |  323 |     336
(1 row)
```

In this example, we used the `CASE` expression to return 1 or 0 if the rental rate falls into each price segment. We applied the [`SUM`](../postgresql-aggregate-functions/postgresql-sum-function) function to calculate the total of films for each price segment.

## Simple PostgreSQL CASE expression

PostgreSQL provides another form of the `CASE` expression called simple form as follows:

```
CASE expression
   WHEN value_1 THEN result_1
   WHEN value_2 THEN result_2
   [WHEN ...]
ELSE
   else_result
END
```

The `CASE` first evaluates the `expression` and compares the result with each value( `value_1`, `value_2`, …) in the `WHEN` clauses sequentially until it finds the match.

Once the result of the `expression` equals a value (value1, value2, etc.) in a `WHEN` clause, the `CASE` returns the corresponding result in the `THEN` clause.

If `CASE` does not find any matches, it returns the `else_result` in that follows the `ELSE`, or `NULL` value if the `ELSE` is not available.

### 1\) Simple PostgreSQL CASE expression example

The following statement uses the `CASE` expression to add the rating description to the output:

```
SELECT title,
       rating,
       CASE rating
           WHEN 'G' THEN 'General Audiences'
           WHEN 'PG' THEN 'Parental Guidance Suggested'
           WHEN 'PG-13' THEN 'Parents Strongly Cautioned'
           WHEN 'R' THEN 'Restricted'
           WHEN 'NC-17' THEN 'Adults Only'
       END rating_description
FROM film
ORDER BY title;
```

Output:

```php
            title            | rating |     rating_description
-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------
 Academy Dinosaur            | PG     | Parental Guidance Suggested
 Ace Goldfinger              | G      | General Audiences
 Adaptation Holes            | NC-17  | Adults Only
 Affair Prejudice            | G      | General Audiences
 African Egg                 | G      | General Audiences
 Agent Truman                | PG     | Parental Guidance Suggested
 Airplane Sierra             | PG-13  | Parents Strongly Cautioned
...
```

In this example, we used a simple `CASE` expression to compare the rating from the `film` table with some literal values like G, PG, NC17, PG\-13 and return the corresponding rating description.

### 2\) Using simple PostgreSQL CASE expression with aggregate function example

The following statement uses `CASE` expression with the `SUM` function to calculate the number of films in each rating:

```
SELECT
  SUM(CASE rating WHEN 'G' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) "General Audiences",
  SUM(
    CASE rating WHEN 'PG' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
  ) "Parental Guidance Suggested",
  SUM(
    CASE rating WHEN 'PG-13' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
  ) "Parents Strongly Cautioned",
  SUM(CASE rating WHEN 'R' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) "Restricted",
  SUM(
    CASE rating WHEN 'NC-17' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
  ) "Adults Only"
FROM
  film;

```

Output:

```
 General Audiences | Parental Guidance Suggested | Parents Strongly Cautioned | Restricted | Adults Only
-------------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------+------------+-------------
               178 |                         194 |                        223 |        195 |         210
(1 row)
```

In this tutorial, you have learned how to use the PostgreSQL `CASE` expression to form complex queries.
