**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to use the PostgreSQL `drop function` statement to remove a function.

## Introduction to PostgreSQL DROP FUNCTION statement

To remove a user\-defined function, you use the `drop function` statement.

Hereâ€™s the syntax of the `drop function` statement:

```sql
drop function [if exists] function_name(argument_list)
[cascade | restrict]
```

In this syntax:

- First, specify the name of the function that you want to remove after the `drop function` keywords.
- Second, use the `if exists` option if you want to instruct PostgreSQL to issue a notice instead of an error if the function does not exist.
- Third, specify the argument list of the function. Since [functions can be overloaded,](plpgsql-function-overloading) PostgreSQL needs to know which function you want to remove by checking the argument list. If a function is unique within the schema, you do not need to specify the argument list.

When a function has any dependent objects such as operators or [triggers](../postgresql-triggers), you cannot drop that function.

To drop the function and its dependent objects, you can use the `cascade` option. The `drop function` with the `cascade` option will recursively remove the function, its dependent objects, and the objects that depend on those objects, and so on.

By default, the `drop function` statement uses the `restrict` option that rejects the removal of a function when it has any dependent objects.

To drop multiple functions using a single `drop function` statement, you specify a comma\-separated list of function names after the `drop function` keyword like this:

```sql
drop function [if exists] function1, function2, ...;
```

## PostgreSQL Drop Function examples

The following statement uses the [`create function`](postgresql-create-function) statement to define a function that returns a set of films including `film_id`, `title`, and `actor`:

```sql
create or replace function get_film_actors()
	returns setof record
as $$
declare
   rec record;
begin
   for rec in select
			film_id,
			title,
            (first_name || ' ' || last_name)::varchar
		from film
		inner join film_actor using(film_id)
		inner join actor using (actor_id)
		order by title
	loop
        return next rec;
	end loop;

	return;
end;
$$
language plpgsql;
```

The following statement defines a function with the same name `get_film_actors`. However, it accepts a film id as the argument:

```sql
create or replace function get_film_actors(p_fiml_id int)
	returns setof record
as $$
declare
   rec record;
begin
   for rec in select
			film_id,
			title,
            (first_name || ' ' || last_name)::varchar
		from film
		inner join film_actor using(film_id)
		inner join actor using (actor_id)
		where film_id = p_fiml_id
		order by title
	loop
        return next rec;
	end loop;

	return;
end;
$$
language plpgsql;
```

The following statement attempts to drop the `get_film_actors` function:

```sql
drop function get_film_actors;
```

PostgreSQL issued an error:

```shell
ERROR:  function name "get_film_actors" is not unique
HINT:  Specify the argument list to select the function unambiguously.
SQL state: 42725
```

Since the `get_film_actors` stored procedure is not unique, you need to specify which function you want to drop.

The following statement drops the `get_film_actors` function that has zero parameters:

```sql
drop function get_film_actors();
```

Now, there is only one `get_film_actors` function left. Since it is unique in the database, you can drop it without specifying its argument list like this:

```sql
drop function get_film_actors;
```

Alternatively, if you want to specify the exact function, you can use the function name with the argument list:

```sql
drop function get_film_actors(int);
```

## Summary

- Use the `drop function` statement to delete a function from a database.
- Specify the argument list in the function if the function is overloaded.
- Use the `drop function` statement with the `cascade` option to drop a function and its dependent objects and objects that depend on those objects, and so on.
