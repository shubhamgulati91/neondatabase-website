**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to perform transactions in PostgreSQL using PHP PDO.

A transaction is a series of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction has four characteristics:

- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability

These characteristics are referred to as ([ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)).

By default, PostgreSQL uses the auto\-commit mode. This means that for every statement that the application issues, PostgreSQL commits it automatically.

To turn off the auto\-commit mode in PHP, you call the `beginTransaction()` method of the PDO object. By doing this, the change to the database is made only when the `commit()` method of the PDO object is called.

If there is an exception or error, you can cancel the change using the `rollback()` method of the PDO object.

The typical usage of the transaction in PHP PDO is as follows:

```phpsqlsql
<?php

try {
    $pdo->beginTransaction();

    $pdo->query("SELECT * FROM table");

    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE QUERY");
    $stmt->execute();

    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("ANOTHER UPDATE QUERY");
    $stmt->execute();

    $db->commit();
} catch (\PDOException $e) {
    $db->rollBack();
    throw $e;
}
```

## PostgreSQL PHP transaction example

We’ll create the following tables for the demonstration:

1. `accounts`: stores the account information such as first name, last name
2. `plans`: stores the plan information for the account such as silver, gold, and platinum.
3. `account_plans` : stores the plan for each account with the effective date.

The following [CREATE TABLE](../postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-create-table) statements create the three tables:

```php
CREATE TABLE accounts(
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   first_name CHARACTER VARYING(100),
   last_name CHARACTER VARYING(100)
);

CREATE TABLE plans(
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   plan CHARACTER VARYING(10) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE account_plans(
   account_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
   plan_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
   effective_date DATE NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (account_id,plan_id),
   FOREIGN KEY(account_id) REFERENCES accounts(id),
   FOREIGN KEY(plan_id) REFERENCES plans(id)
);
```

The following [INSERT](insert) statement inserts some sample data into the `plans` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO plans(plan) VALUES('SILVER'),('GOLD'),('PLATINUM');
```

When creating an account, you need to assign a plan that can be silver, gold, or platinum. To ensure that an account always has at least one plan at a time, you use the transaction API in PDO.

The following `addAccount()` method performs two main steps:

- First, insert an account into the `accounts` table and return the account id.
- Then, assign the account a specific plan by inserting a new row into the `account_plans` table.

At the beginning of the method, you call the `beginTransaction()` method of the PDO object to start the transaction.

If all the steps succeed, you call the `commit()` method to save the changes. If an exception occurs in any step, you roll back the changes by calling the `rollback()` method in the `catch` block:

```text
   /**
     * Add a new account
     * @param string $firstName
     * @param string $lastName
     * @param int $planId
     * @param date $effectiveDate
     */
    public function addAccount($firstName, $lastName, $planId, $effectiveDate) {
        try {
            // start the transaction
            $this->pdo->beginTransaction();

            // insert an account and get the ID back
            $accountId = $this->insertAccount($firstName, $lastName);

            // add plan for the account
            $this->insertPlan($accountId, $planId, $effectiveDate);

            // commit the changes
            $this->pdo->commit();
        } catch (\PDOException $e) {
            // rollback the changes
            $this->pdo->rollBack();
            throw $e;
        }
    }
```

The `addAccount()` method uses two other private methods: `insertAccount()` and `insertPlan()` as shown in the following:

```php
   /**
     *
     * @param string $firstName
     * @param string $lastName
     * @return int
     */
    private function insertAccount($firstName, $lastName) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare(
                'INSERT INTO accounts(first_name,last_name) '
                . 'VALUES(:first_name,:last_name)');

        $stmt->execute([
            ':first_name' => $firstName,
            ':last_name' => $lastName
        ]);

        return $this->pdo->lastInsertId('accounts_id_seq');
    }
```

```php
   /**
     * insert a new plan for an account
     * @param int $accountId
     * @param int $planId
     * @param int $effectiveDate
     * @return bool
     */
    private function insertPlan($accountId, $planId, $effectiveDate) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare(
                'INSERT INTO account_plans(account_id,plan_id,effective_date) '
                . 'VALUES(:account_id,:plan_id,:effective_date)');

        return $stmt->execute([
                    ':account_id' => $accountId,
                    ':plan_id' => $planId,
                    ':effective_date' => $effectiveDate,
        ]);
    }
```

To test the `AccountDB` class, you use the following code in the `index.php` file.

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use PostgreSQLTutorial\Connection as Connection;
use PostgreSQLTutorial\AccountDB as AccountDB;

try {
    // connect to the PostgreSQL database
    $pdo = Connection::get()->connect();

    $accountDB = new AccountDB($pdo);

    // add accounts
    $accountDB->addAccount('John', 'Doe', 1, date('Y-m-d'));
    $accountDB->addAccount('Linda', 'Williams', 2, date('Y-m-d'));
    $accountDB->addAccount('Maria', 'Miller', 3, date('Y-m-d'));


    echo 'The new accounts have been added.' . '<br>';
    //
    $accountDB->addAccount('Susan', 'Wilson', 99, date('Y-m-d'));
} catch (\PDOException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

How it works.

- First, connect to the PostgreSQL database.
- Second, insert three accounts with silver, gold, and platinum levels.
- Third, try to insert one more account but with a plan ID that does not exist in the `plans` table. Based on the input, the step of assigning the plan to the account fails which causes the whole transaction to be rolled back.

The following shows the output of the index.php file:

```
The new accounts have been added.

SQLSTATE[23503]: Foreign key violation: 7 ERROR: insert or update on table "account_plans" violates foreign key constraint "account_plans_plan_id_fkey" DETAIL: Key (plan_id)=(99) is not present in table "plans".
```

If you query the data in the `accounts` and `account_plans` tables, you will see only three rows inserted in each table:

```
stocks=# SELECT * FROM accounts;
 id | first_name | last_name
----+------------+-----------
  1 | John       | Doe
  2 | Linda      | Williams
  3 | Maria      | Miller
(3 rows)

stocks=# SELECT * FROM account_plans;
 account_id | plan_id | effective_date
------------+---------+----------------
          1 |       1 | 2016-06-13
          2 |       2 | 2016-06-13
          3 |       3 | 2016-06-13
(3 rows)
```

## Summary

- Use the `beginTransaction`() method of the PDO object to start a transaction.
- Use the `commit()` method to apply the changes to the database and `rollback()` method to undo the changes.
