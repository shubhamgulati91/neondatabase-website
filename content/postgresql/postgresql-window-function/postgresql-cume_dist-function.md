**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to use the PostgreSQL `CUME_DIST()` function to calculate the cumulative distribution of a value within a set of values.

## PostgreSQL CUME_DIST() function overview

Sometimes, you may want to create a report that shows the top or bottom x% values from a data set, for example, top 1% of products by revenue. Fortunately, PostgreSQL provides us with the `CUME_DIST()` function to calculate it.

The `CUME_DIST()` function returns the cumulative distribution of a value within a set of values. In other words, it returns the relative position of a value in a set of values.

The syntax of the `CUME_DIST()` function is as follows:

```text
 CUME_DIST() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)

```

Let’s examine this syntax in detail.

### PARTITION BY clause

The `PARTITION BY` clause divides rows into multiple partitions to which the function is applied.

The `PARTITION BY` clause is optional. If you skip it, the `CUME_DIST()` function will treat the whole result set as a single partition.

### ORDER BY clause

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts rows in each partition to which the `CUME_DIST()` function is applied.

### Return value

The `CUME_DIST()` a double precision value which is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1:

```sql
0 < CUME_DIST() <= 1

```

The function returns the same cumulative distribution values for the same tie values.

## PostgreSQL CUME_DIST() examples

First, [create a new table](../postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-create-table) named `sales_stats` that stores the  sales revenue by employees:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_stats(
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    year SMALLINT NOT NULL CHECK (year > 0),
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (amount >= 0),
    PRIMARY KEY (name,year)
);

```

Second, [insert](../postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-insert) some rows into the `sales_stats` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO
    sales_stats(name, year, amount)
VALUES
    ('John Doe',2018,120000),
    ('Jane Doe',2018,110000),
    ('Jack Daniel',2018,150000),
    ('Yin Yang',2018,30000),
    ('Stephane Heady',2018,200000),
    ('John Doe',2019,150000),
    ('Jane Doe',2019,130000),
    ('Jack Daniel',2019,180000),
    ('Yin Yang',2019,25000),
    ('Stephane Heady',2019,270000);

```

The following examples help you get a better understanding of the `CUME_DIST()` function.

### 1\) Using PostgreSQL CUME_DIST() function over a result set example

The following example returns the sales amount percentile for each sales employee in 2018:

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    year,
    amount,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (
        ORDER BY amount
    )
FROM
    sales_stats
WHERE
    year = 2018;

```

Here is the output:

![PostgreSQL CUME_DIST Function over a result set example](/postgresqltutorial/PostgreSQL-CUME_DIST-Function-over-a-result-set-example.png)As clearly shown in the output, we can find that 80% of sales employees have sales less than or equal to 150K in 2018\.

### 2\) Using PostgreSQL CUME_DIST() function over a partition example

The following example uses the `CUME_DIST()` function to calculate the sales percentile for each sales employee in 2018 and 2019\.

```sql
SELECT
    name,
	year,
	amount,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (
		PARTITION BY year
        ORDER BY amount
    )
FROM
    sales_stats;

```

Here is the output:

![PostgreSQL CUME_DIST Function over a partition example](/postgresqltutorial/PostgreSQL-CUME_DIST-Function-over-a-partition-example.png)
In this example:

- The `PARTITION BY`clause divided the rows into two partitions by the year 2018 and 2019\.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorted sales amount of every employee in each partition from high to low to which the `CUME_DIST()` function is applied.

In this tutorial, you have learned how to use the PostgreSQL `CUME_DIST()` function to calculate the cumulative distribution of a value in a group of values.
