**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to use the PostgreSQL `CREATE VIEW` statement to create a new view in your database.

## PostgreSQL CREATE VIEW statement

In PostgreSQL, a view is a named query stored in the database server. To create a new view, you can use the `CREATE VIEW` statement.

Here’s the basic syntax of the `CREATE VIEW` statement:

```phpsql
CREATE VIEW view_name
AS
  query;
```

In this syntax:

- First, specify the name of the view after the `CREATE VIEW` keywords.
- Second, specify a `SELECT` statement (`query`) that defines the view. The query is often referred to as the **defining query** of the view.

## PostgreSQL CREATE VIEW statement examples

Let’s take some examples of using the `CREATE VIEW` statement.

We’ll use the `customer` table from the [sample database](../postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database):

### 1\) Basic CREATE VIEW statement example

The following example uses the `CREATE VIEW` statement to create a view based on the `customer` table:

```sql
CREATE VIEW contact AS
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email
FROM
  customer;
```

Output:

```sql
CREATE VIEW
```

The following query data from the `contact` view:

```
SELECT * FROM contact;
```

Output:

```text
 first_name  |  last_name   |                  email
-------------+--------------+------------------------------------------
 Jared       | Ely          | [[email protected]](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html)
 Mary        | Smith        | [[email protected]](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html)
 Patricia    | Johnson      | [[email protected]](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html)
...
```

### 2\) Using the CREATE VIEW statement to create a view based on a complex query

The following example creates a view based on the tables `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country`:

```
CREATE VIEW customer_info AS
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email,
  phone,
  city,
  postal_code,
  country
FROM
  customer
  INNER JOIN address USING (address_id)
  INNER JOIN city USING (city_id)
  INNER JOIN country USING (country_id);
```

The following query retrieves data from the `customer_info` view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer_info;
```

Output:

```
 first_name  |  last_name   |                  email                   |    phone     |            city            | postal_code |                country
-------------+--------------+------------------------------------------+--------------+----------------------------+-------------+---------------------------------------
 Jared       | Ely          | [[email protected]](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html)             | 35533115997  | Purwakarta                 | 25972       | Indonesia
 Mary        | Smith        | [[email protected]](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html)            | 28303384290  | Sasebo                     | 35200       | Japan
 Patricia    | Johnson      | [[email protected]](../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html)      | 838635286649 | San Bernardino             | 17886       | United States
...
```

### 3\) Creating a view based on another view

The following statement creates a view called `customer_usa` based on the `customer_info` view. The `customer_usa` returns the customers who are in the `United States`:

```
CREATE VIEW customer_usa
AS
SELECT
  *
FROM
  customer_info
WHERE
  country = 'United States';
```

Here’s the query that retrieves data from the customer_usa view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer_usa;
```

Output:

```
 first_name | last_name  |                email                 |    phone     |          city           | postal_code |    country

## Replacing a view

To change the defining query of a view, you use the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statement:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name
AS
  query;
```

In this syntax, you add the `OR REPLACE` between the `CREATE` and `VIEW` keywords. If the view already exists, the statement replaces the existing view; otherwise, it creates a new view.

For example, the following statement changes the defining query of the `contact` view to include the `phone` information from the `address` table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW contact AS
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email,
  phone
FROM
  customer
INNER JOIN address USING (address_id);
```

## Display a view on psql

To display a view on `psql`, you follow these steps:

First, open the Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Unix\-like systems and connect to the PostgreSQL server:

```
psql -U postgres
```

Second, change the current database to `dvdrental`:

```
\c dvdrental
```

Third, display the view information using the `\d+ view_name` command. For example, the following shows the `contact` view:

```
\d+ contact
```

Output:

```
                                    View "public.contact"
   Column   |         Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage  | Description
------------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------+----------+-------------
 first_name | character varying(45) |           |          |         | extended |
 last_name  | character varying(45) |           |          |         | extended |
 email      | character varying(50) |           |          |         | extended |
 phone      | character varying(20) |           |          |         | extended |
View definition:
 SELECT customer.first_name,
    customer.last_name,
    customer.email,
    address.phone
   FROM customer
     JOIN address USING (address_id);

```

## Summary

- Use the PostgreSQL `CREATE VIEW` statement to create a new view in your database.
- Use the `\d+` command in psql to display the information of a view.
